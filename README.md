React task - fetch color from colr.org
This app fetches random color from colr.org, adds it to a list if it is not already in it
and sets this color to button text color. User can enter the color manually - if it is valid color and not
in the color list, it is added and set as current color. User can shuffle colors in a list.
Currently there is a bug when run in Chrome - if app is not run in developer mode, only one color is fetched
as response by fetch is repeated
